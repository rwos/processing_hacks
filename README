Just some small hacks written in Processing.
(see http://processing.org for the language itself)

These hacks are Free Software, do with them whatever you want.

    canvas_game_of_life
        A "living" drawing canvas. 

    fractal_garden
        A very simple fractal viewer. 

    fractal_garden_2
        More or less a combination of the two above. 

    the_dark_side
        An interactive version of Pink Floyd's famous
        Dark Side of the Moon album cover. 

Note: This is not exactly beautiful code. Processing somewhat invites
one to just "hack until it works". But I think that's fine for those
kind of silly applets.
